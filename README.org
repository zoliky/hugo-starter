*Work in progress*

This project aims to serve as a base when building a new website with Hugo.

** Installation

Assuming that Hugo has been already installed on your computer, issue the
following commands in your terminal:

#+begin_src shell
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/zoliky/hugo-starter.git
$ cd hugo-starter
$ hugo server
#+end_src

** Pages

*** Home page

Hugo uses a separate layout for the home page because it assumes
you'll want your home page to have a different look than other
content pages.

When Hugo builds the site, it'll construct the home page by combining
the content file ~content/_index.org~ with the layout file
~themes/basic/layouts/index.html~, which will then use the baseof file
~/themes/basic/layout/_default/baseof.html~.
