* Home page

Welcome!

Hugo uses a separate layout for the home page because it assumes
you'll want your home page to have a different look than other
content pages.

When Hugo builds the site, it'll construct the home page by combining
the content file ~content/_index.org~ with the layout file
~themes/basic/layouts/index.html~, which will then use the baseof file
~/themes/basic/layout/_default/baseof.html~.

This project is provided as-is. I do not accept pull requests.
I built this project to serve as a starter for new projects at [[https://www.kingwebsolutions.net/][King Web Solutions]].
